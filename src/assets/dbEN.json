        "descriptionProjet": "Based on the universe created by Daniel Friedman and CROM, Raiders allows you to embody <b>Marken</b>, a seasoned raider, traveling from town to town and dungeon to dungeon in search of treasures and perilous adventures! Raiders is a <b>prototype of an action-adventure RPG</b> game that skillfully blends elements of <b>dungeon crawling</b> and <b>Hack 'n' Slash</b>. In this game, players explore a medieval fantasy world filled with dungeons, monstrous creatures, and riches waiting to be unearthed. This project is divided into <b>two distinct levels</b>: the market, a tourist attraction, and the catacombs, a den of monsters and treasures. As a member of a two-person team, <b>my mission was to design the catacombs level</b>.",

            "The Market :",
            "Located at the top of a coastal highland region, this area quickly became a <b>favorite destination for Raiders</b> following the discovery of the catacombs. A thriving market has thus established itself here to attract adventurers in search of fortune. However, access to the dungeon is <b>now controlled by the royal guards</b>, forcing the daring to obtain a <b>permit</b> before entering. The challenge of this level is to obtain this permit in one of three possible ways. While exploring the market, players can also enjoy various <b>attractions</b>, participate in <b>arena battles</b>, check the <b>wanted posters</b> of criminals, or simply listen to the <b>conversations</b> of merchants. This level is full of interactions with NPCs who can assist the player in their quest and offer new opportunities for a well-deserved reward!"

            "After exploring the market, players can enter the catacombs by passing through the hidden door in the massive stone sword at the tip of the peninsula. Named the Crypts of the Lover, these catacombs represent the underground passages of a fallen kingdom, brimming with <b>treasures</b>, <b>traps</b>, and now inhabited by <b>terrifying creatures</b>. The interior is immense, vast, and deep. Carved into a massive underwater cavern, <b>light is scarce</b>, obliging adventurers to equip themselves with light sources to avoid <b>unpleasant surprises</b>. Players must navigate through different levels and secret passages to discover the buried wealth. Raiders will traverse numerous rooms and face various challenges, including a <b>banquet hall</b>l, a <b>prison</b>, a <b>library</b>, a <b>crypt</b>, and much more! The dungeon is also teeming with <b>skeletal soldiers</b>, once avid adventurers revived by an unknown force and compelled to protect the riches they once coveted."

            "Our primary source of inspiration for this game was, of course, the comic <b>Raiders</b> by Daniel Friedman and CROM. We also drew elements from games such as <b>Skyrim</b>, <b>Dark Souls</b>, and even <b>Adventure Time</b> to create our gameplay mechanics and environments. My primary inspiration for the catacombs level was <b>the Mines of Moria</b> from The Lord of the Rings, as I have always been fascinated by their grandeur and oppressive atmosphere. Additionally, I drew inspiration from the layout of Bloodborne's <b>Chalice Dungeons</b> to create <b>a linear and interconnected level</b>. Raiders remains one of my favorite projects to date. I thoroughly enjoyed designing the catacombs level and crafting a detailed environment that reflects the universe of our game! Despite the countless hours invested in this prototype, I experienced complete satisfaction, confirming my passion for level design."

The first part of the project involves creating a semi-realistic universe set in 19th century Louisiana. In this world, a profound darkness reigns, populated by morbid creatures of all kinds. No one knows exactly why, but the epicenter of this darkness appears to emanate from a region erased from the maps: the Moving Slough, an extremely perilous territory that only the most daring hunters dare to explore. The second part of the project focuses on creating a game level that allows players to explore this swamp and uncover clues and traces of a bloody event.",

This choice stems from my desire to create something specific, highlighting a unique location. This approach facilitated its representation as an exploratory level, where players can gather clues about the mysterious events that took place in this universe. For the level's design, I began the process by drawing a detailed map to ensure that all paths could be connected, with almost all leading to the center of the swamp. In the editor, the most crucial aspect of production was ensuring that the player was skillfully guided to the heart of the swamp, where most of the key elements are concentrated."

The primary challenges related to level design were associated with the use of Unreal Engine's terrain tool and ensuring that all paths were accessible and navigable. With limited experience with this tool, I had to go through numerous trial-and-error attempts to achieve the result I am proud of today.

As for the level design, I drew extensive inspiration from swamp levels in games like The Witcher, Hunt: Showdown, and Weird West. My love for the western theme has always been a source of inspiration for me, and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to explore this genre and create my own altered universe."

One of our major challenges in designing the board was to accurately represent the real anatomy of the brain by placing the areas correctly and connecting them appropriately. It was also crucial to distribute points judiciously in different areas, awarding more points to challenging-to-control zones and fewer points to less strategic zones, such as those located in the corners of the board. Another key challenge during production was balancing the powers of different zones and event cards. Since the abilities of event cards are tied to the player's emotion revealing them, we had to ensure, after many playtesting sessions, that no emotion became too dominant compared to others."

The objective is clear: players must work as a team to repair the spacecraft and eliminate the extraterrestrial threat before it becomes unstoppable.",

            "Major Innovation!",
            "This game features a unique feature: the use of a mobile application is essential to play. This application not only times the allotted time for the crew members to complete their objectives but also adds a dose of stress by allowing the extraterrestrial creature to move randomly. At predefined intervals, an alarm sounds on the application, forcing players to interrupt their actions to move the creature following the instructions provided by the mobile app."

            "My primary role in this project was designing the game rules in collaboration with other team members. I also programmed the mobile application and contributed to graphic design and the creation of the physical prototype. This prototype was developed by a team of 4 people over a period of 8 weeks.Our biggest challenge was finding a way to make the game faster and less repetitive than our initial ideas, which turned out to be too long and monotonous for players. That's why we decided to introduce the randomness mechanic via the mobile application, ensuring unique gameplay every time. Additionally, to eliminate monotony, we incorporated a mechanic where a player becomes the team leader each turn and assigns actions to other players, maintaining a dynamic pace, especially if a traitor is part of the game."

Visually, we drew inspiration from space depictions of the 1940s-50s and the graphic style of pulp science fiction."

Additionally, this project provided me with the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of particle effects, fractal noise, and 3D creation within After Effects."

So, my desire was to create something similar."
