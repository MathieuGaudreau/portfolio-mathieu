        "Space Scoundrel is a third-person shooting game of the 'Action Roguelike' style, in which the player takes on the role of a space pirate whose goal is to board a ship and take all its loot. The player will be able to explore a procedurally generated ship, where they will encounter different types of enemies and weapons to defend themselves.",
        "The player's goal will be to navigate their way through the ship and survive until they reach the control room to be able to take control of the ship and complete the game. If the player dies, they will have to start over from the beginning in a new procedurally generated dungeon.",
        "My main roles in this project were to be the systems designer and programmer for the dungeon generation system, weapons, character, and enemies. I therefore created a dungeon generation system that takes room prefabs and creates a path on a grid based on the desired size. I also created a weapons system that all have different statistics, providing varied gameplay for the player depending on the weapon they choose to use. The biggest challenge of this project was definitely the enemy system, as I had little experience with state machines, so I had to do a lot of research on the subject to understand how they work. This part of the project took the most time, but I think I got a good result for a first experience.",
        "I am very proud of the outcome of this project, it has become the most extensive project I have done to date.",
        "This project was developed by a team of 2 people and took 6 weeks."

My main responsibilities were to draw all the tiles used to build the levels, draw the enemies and their animations, and draw various decorative elements. I also served as a level designer in this project, and my goal was to build the different levels so that they were interesting in both the normal and imaginary worlds.",

The challenge was to make the normal world just as attractive by placing different interactions, NPCs, and objects in the world that have a different outcome depending on the world we are in."
